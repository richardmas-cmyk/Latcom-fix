# Latcom Billing System - Scalability Report
**Target:** 10,000 transactions/day (~$30,000 USD daily volume)

## Current Improvements ‚úÖ

### 1. Database Connection Pool
- **Before:** 5 connections (max)
- **After:** 20 connections with 5 minimum ready
- **Impact:** Can handle 4x concurrent database operations

### 2. Admin Panel
- Real-time credit management
- Multi-customer support
- Transaction filtering and export
- CSV export for accounting
- **Access:** `https://latcom-fix-production.up.railway.app/admin`

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
- Today's volume tracking
- Success rate monitoring
- Per-customer transaction history
- Balance alerts (low/medium/good)

---

## Current System Capacity

### Latcom API Performance
- **Average response time:** 6-7 seconds per top-up
- **Single-threaded max:** ~10 transactions/minute
- **With 20 DB connections:** ~20-30 transactions/minute theoretically

### Real Bottlenecks
1. **Latcom API latency:** 6-7 seconds per request (cannot be improved on our end)
2. **Synchronous processing:** Each request waits for Latcom response
3. **No queueing system:** Requests pile up during peak hours

## Can Railway Handle 10,000 Transactions/Day?

### Peak Hour Analysis
- 10,000 txs/day √∑ 24 hours = 417 txs/hour average
- Assuming 8-hour peak window: ~1,250 txs/hour peak
- **Peak load:** ~21 transactions/minute

### Current Setup Assessment
| Metric | Current | Required | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Avg TPS | 0.3/sec | 0.35/sec | ‚ö†Ô∏è MARGINAL |
| Peak TPS | 0.3/sec | 0.5/sec | ‚ùå INSUFFICIENT |
| DB Connections | 20 | 20-30 | ‚úÖ OK |
| Memory | 512MB | 1GB | ‚ö†Ô∏è UPGRADE NEEDED |
| CPU | Shared | Dedicated | ‚ö†Ô∏è UPGRADE NEEDED |

**Verdict:** Current setup will struggle at peak hours (21+ txs/minute)

## Recommended Upgrades for 10K Daily Volume

### Phase 1: Immediate (Do Now) üî¥
1. **Upgrade Railway Plan**
   - From: Hobby ($5/mo)
   - To: Pro Plan ($20/mo)
   - Benefits:
     - 8GB RAM (vs 512MB)
     - Dedicated CPU
     - Better performance

2. **Add Environment Variable for Admin Key**
   ```
   ADMIN_KEY=your_secure_admin_password_here
   ```

3. **Enable Railway Horizontal Scaling**
   - Scale to 2-3 instances
   - Railway auto-load balances
   - Cost: ~$40-60/mo total

### Phase 2: Next 2 Weeks (High Priority) üü°
4. **Implement Redis Caching**
   - Add Redis service on Railway (~$10/mo)
   - Cache customer balances
   - Reduce DB queries by 60%
   - **Impact:** 2-3x faster balance checks

5. **Add Job Queue (Bull + Redis)**
   - Queue top-up requests
   - Process asynchronously
   - Handle burst traffic
   - **Impact:** Can queue 1000s of requests

6. **Database Indexing**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_customer ON transactions(customer_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_created ON transactions(created_at);
   CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_phone ON transactions(phone);
   ```
   - **Impact:** 10x faster queries

### Phase 3: Before Hitting 5K Daily (Optional) üü¢
7. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent API abuse
   - Fair usage per customer
   - DDoS protection

8. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Add Sentry for error tracking
   - Add DataDog/LogTail for logs
   - Alert when balance < $1000

9. **Database Replication**
   - Read replicas for reporting
   - Separate read/write operations
   - **Impact:** Better dashboard performance
