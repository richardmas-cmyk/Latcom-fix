WHAT WE'VE VERIFIED ON OUR SIDE
================================================================================

✅ Our server can reach lattest.mitopup.com
✅ DNS is resolving correctly
✅ Our IP address (162.220.234.15) is stable and unchanged
✅ Our credentials are correct (same as when it was working)
✅ Our code has not changed
✅ The error message specifically says "IP Address not authorized"
✅ The server IS responding (it's not down)
✅ The server IS processing our request (it's validating credentials)
✅ The server IS rejecting us based on IP address

================================================================================
PROOF THAT CREDENTIALS ARE CORRECT
================================================================================

When tested from VPN (different IP):
- Same credentials work ✅
- Same endpoint works ✅
- Same request body works ✅

When tested from Railway (162.220.234.15):
- Same credentials fail ❌
- Same endpoint fails ❌
- Same request body fails ❌

The ONLY difference is the source IP address.

This proves:
1. Credentials are correct
2. Endpoint is correct
3. Request format is correct
4. IP whitelist is the problem

================================================================================
TIMELINE
================================================================================

BEFORE (Working for weeks):
- Railway IP: 162.220.234.15
- Status: WORKING
- Credentials: Same as now
- Code: Same as now

NOW (Suddenly broken):
- Railway IP: 162.220.234.15 (UNCHANGED)
- Status: BLOCKED
- Credentials: Same as before (UNCHANGED)
- Code: Same as before (UNCHANGED)

What changed?
- NOT our IP address
- NOT our credentials
- NOT our code
- NOT our endpoint URL

The ONLY logical conclusion:
- Latcom's IP whitelist configuration changed
- OR our IP was removed from the whitelist
- OR the whitelist was reset/cleared

================================================================================
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE
================================================================================

1. The error message is EXPLICIT:
   "IP Address not authorized"

   This is not:
   - "Invalid credentials" ❌
   - "Invalid username" ❌
   - "Invalid password" ❌
   - "Invalid API key" ❌
   - "Invalid UID" ❌

   It specifically says: "IP Address not authorized"

2. The HTTP status is 400 (Validation Error)
   - This means the request reached the server
   - The server validated the request
   - The server rejected it based on IP address

3. Our diagnostics show:
   - Server is UP and responding
   - Network path is clear
   - DNS is working
   - Only authentication is blocked

================================================================================
WHAT LATCOM NEEDS TO CHECK
================================================================================

1. Check IP whitelist for user "enviadespensa"
   - Look for: 162.220.234.15
   - Verify it exists in the whitelist

2. Check if whitelist was recently modified
   - Check audit logs
   - Check recent configuration changes
   - Check if there was a system update/restart

3. Check if there's a new whitelist requirement
   - Was a new firewall rule added?
   - Was the whitelist moved to a different system?
   - Was there a security update?

4. Verify the whitelist is active
   - Is the IP whitelist feature enabled?
   - Is it being enforced?
   - Are there multiple whitelists (dev/test/prod)?

================================================================================
REQUEST TO LATCOM
================================================================================

Please verify the IP whitelist configuration for:
- User: enviadespensa
- UID: 20060916
- IP to whitelist: 162.220.234.15

Our diagnostics prove that:
1. Nothing changed on our side
2. The issue is IP-based blocking
3. The error message confirms this

We need 162.220.234.15 added to (or re-added to) the whitelist.

================================================================================
TECHNICAL PROOF SUMMARY
================================================================================

✅ DNS working
✅ Network working
✅ Server reachable
✅ IP stable (162.220.234.15)
✅ Credentials unchanged and correct
✅ Code unchanged
✅ Endpoint unchanged
❌ IP whitelist blocking us

Conclusion: This is 100% an IP whitelist configuration issue on Latcom's side.
